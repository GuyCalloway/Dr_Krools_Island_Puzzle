# Dr_Krools_Island_Puzzle

Guess what hat you’re wearing – or die!

Fiendish Dr Krool has captured a large number of tourists on his island (number/gender does not matter).

He says he is going to line them up in a queue so that each of them can only see the captives in front of them and cannot see anyone behind them.  

He will then give each of them a hat which will be either red or blue.  He will start at the front of the queue and work backwards.  The number of hats is completely random and so is the distribution along the line. 
Thus: everyone can see the hats of those in front of them but none of the hats behind them. 

He will then instruct everyone to guess what hat they are wearing – STARTING WITH THE TOURIST AT THE BACK OF THE LINE and then going forward from along along the line. They can only say one of two words: “RED” or “BLUE”.
Those who guess the correct colour of hat will live, those who guess the wrong colour of hat will die. They will not be aware whether the previous tourists in the line are to be killed or not. 

He allows the tourists to mingle together for an hour and enjoy a glass of his famous punch - and then it will be time to line up! 
During this time you are designated the leader and must come up with a plan to save as many people as possible!!

What is your strategy?
